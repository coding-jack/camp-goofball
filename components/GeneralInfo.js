This doesn't mean you can't come by yourself, but let's all try to be as efficient as possible with the beautiful ranch we booked for the weekend.</p>
            <p className="z-0 p-auto md:pt-6">This is a leave no trace camping event, so pack it in and pack it out. You will need to bring everything for the weekend, especially food, water, shelter, and a good attitude. Do not leave your garbage, plan on taking it with you. There will be a porto-john for you plebes. If you have anything that you would like to contribute to the event, that would be fantastic. Reach out to your favorite Camp Goofball Representative (listed below) and let us know. This could be anything from food and beverage, to lighting and special effects, to extra shade structure, and decorations. Remember it takes a village y'all.</p>
            <p className="z-0 p-auto md:pt-6">For the overall safety of the event, we ask that you please leave all weapons at home.</p>

          <p className="z-0 p-auto md:pt-6">We will have themed parties for Friday and Saturday night, as well as additional activities, lawn games, and communal art projects happening throughout the weekend.
            Make your plans to attend, by reserving your spot immediately. This event is
            being capped at ????people and will absolutely sell out. Don't be stuck
            at home wishing you were at Camp Goofball. See you this summer,
            goofballs!</p>
