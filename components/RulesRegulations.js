          agents, unregistered agents, employees, and volunteers, and their
          respective subsidiaries and affiliates of all legal liability of the
          same.  In the event of a claim, the patron or attendee agrees that the
          jurisdiction in which the alleged incident occurred shall be the
          appropriate forum and that state, provincial or federal laws of that
          jurisdiction will apply.  Additional endorsements are as follows:</p>

          <p className="z-0 p-auto md:pt-6">No
          pets - including dogs, cats, birds, or any other animals - are allowed
          anywhere on the Festival grounds, campgrounds, or parking lots/cars. It
          would be cruel to bring your pet to this Festival.</p>

          <p className="z-0 p-auto md:pt-6">No
          weapons, registered or otherwise, are permitted at or near the Camp
          Goofball location, grounds and/or parking lot. This exclusion applies
          even if they are located within a person or persons, private vehicles or
          domiciles.</p>

          <p className="z-0 p-auto md:pt-6">Glass will not be permitted at or near the Camp Goofball location, grounds, and/or parking lots.</p>

          <p className="z-0 p-auto md:pt-6">No re-entry.  Any ticket holders that leave the festival grounds will not be permitted to re-enter.</p>

          <p className="z-0 p-auto md:pt-6">The Festival gates will be open between 12 pm - 9 pm on Friday and 10 am - 8 pm on Saturday. Please arrive before dark, so you can safely enter, and have light to set up your camp.</p>

          <p className="z-0 p-auto md:pt-6">Cell service is spotty at best. All festival-goers should download the Google map route, and tickets ahead of time.</p>

          <p className="z-0 p-auto md:pt-6">This is a leave no trace camping event, so pack it in and pack it out. You will need to bring everything for the weekend, especially food, water, shelter, and a good attitude. Do not leave your garbage, plan on taking it with you.</p>
